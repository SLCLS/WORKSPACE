## CROSS-PLATFORM WORKSPACE
This repository serves as a personal cross-platform ( **_VS Code_ & _GitHub Codespace_** ) repository and developer environment setup for both ***Windows 10/11*** and ***Linux devices or Virtual Machines***.

> Supports seamless virtual environment (venv) creation with compiled standard utility libraries for both Python (3.13.0) and C++ (23, 14882 : 2024).

> High Visual Studio Code environment customization (for both personalization & execution utility) under the .vscode module in root.

> Fully tested and standardized developer container for docker and Linux environment as well as flexible Makefile that supports Windows & Linux.

## MY DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHT
| PROGRAM  | FEATURE OVERVIEW |
| :-------------------: | :---------- |
| **[Arrow Solver](https://github.com/SLCLS/WORKSPACE/tree/main/PERSONAL/PYTHON/MAJOR/ARROW-SOLVER)** | This Python program can solve **Arrow Puzzle** in ***Hard difficulty*** automatically for the game **"Exponential Idle"** using **cv2 (OpenCV)** for *Puzzle Mapping* and **PpADB (Pure Python ADB)** for *Automation*.. It implements Computer Vision using **CV2** and it process the image to recognize the puzzle Circles and it's color on the screen. **PpADB** is then used for Android integration, thus, this program works for **Android devices only** |
